Scripts developed under python 3.7 (3.6 should also be fine).

Environment setup:

    provision.py - Run this script to download and compile (requires make and gcc) colouring algorithm source and download evolved graph instances.
    requirements.txt - Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to load necessary python libraries for feature calculation.

Scripts:

    evaluate.py - Runs feature calculation and colouring heuristics on the evolved graph instance set.
    instance_space.py - Produce figures showing the projected instance space for this data set.

Data sets:

    evolved-instances-results.json - Stored output of evaluate.py (takes a while to recalculate for the full data set).

Library files:

    algorithms.py - Contains functions to run Culberson algorithms.
    features.py - Contains functions for feature calculation.
